  Visualizing information that is designed to help someone looking to move to a new city understand the housing market, income, top industry, and quality of life metrics. This tool also includes a near-future price prediction, based on a linear regression machine learning model.  

  This was the final group project in my Boot Camp. The project was designed to showcase the ETL process, our ability to use AWS to create and host a database, extensive machine learning models to try and predict the housing prices, and our ability to visualize and present the information in a dashboard.
toolsSkills: Tableau, Machine Learning, ETL, Python, SQL, AWS
